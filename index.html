<p>Hey.
This is probably the fifth time I've tried getting a blog up and running.
I've quit the other times for reasons (or lack of reasons?) that I don't really know myself.
A small, personal internet corner where I clickity-clack at a keyboard and put stuff out there is appealing to me.
A repository of public notes (Zettelkasten-style!) and a place for writing probably coherent thoughts.
Something that's mine.</p>

<p>I guess you could call it a "second brain", or keep a scrapbook instead.
Anyways, the few times I have tried, I'd either think my content wasn't "good enough" to deserve the few kilobytes it occupies on GitHub, or that my opinions weren't insightful/revolutionary/enlightening enough to be worth reading, or that the styling was too much, or that the styling was too little.

<p>That's sufficient introduction.
Will, maybe, get back to you with more about me.</p>
