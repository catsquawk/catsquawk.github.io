<td>Going pretty great. Feels nice to be in control like this.</td>

<td>Oct 17</td>
<td>Also good, did get distracted by YouTube, though. I'll look into some no-tech activities to do in free time?</td>

<td>Oct 18</td>
<td>Ehhh... veered a bit off course. Back to day 1, I guess.</td>

<td>Oct 19</td>
<td>Nope. Need to think a few things over about how I'm approaching this.</td>

<tr>
<td>Oct 20</td>
<td>Went great. I used to keep the tracker in a notebook I barely looked at, so I guess the lack of cue caused me to forget and go off track. I now have a BetterCounter widget on my home screen, and enabled a userscript that blocks all distracting websites the night before. <br /> Think I'll look into gesture drawing and <a href="https://alfredvalley.itch.io/diedream/">Diedream</a> as stuff to do in free time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oct 21</td>
<td>Also good. Maybe I can surpass my previous 2-day streak (personal best, btw). <br /> I <i>did</i> delay the last action of the routine in favour of a short lie-down. I didn't get distracted like last time, so does it count? I should probably be more clear-cut on what a successful morning is. <br /> Anyways, today's a success, in my eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oct 22</td>
<td>Also went well. There is a small thing I need to work out, but still good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oct 23</td>
<td>Smashed it. I managed to somehow spend 30 minutes after testing out different calculator apps? I don't even use my phone's calculator. ðŸ˜­ <br /> Scrolled on Reddit a bit, haven't done that in ages. Got ChatGPT to spew a userscript that blocks all reddit urls that aren't a specific post. So, I should still be able to click on Google results, but not doomscroll. <br /> For the bursts of app testing, could focus mode work? Or excluding apps from KISS? Both are easily circumventable, though. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oct 24</td>
<td>Also went great. <br /> Unrelated, but I gave audiobooks a try yesterday. I use an Android ereader to read, and Libby's (or, rather, Adobe's) DRM made reading borrowed books <i>such</i> a hassle. Digital Editions is terrible on Android (actually, terrible, full stop) so I had to use the Pocketbook app. It was much better, but still too fiddly for me to bear. Send the .acsm to my ereader, authenticate with Adobe, fiddle with rendering options because images just <i>don't work</i> sometimes and only <i>then</i> can you enjoy a subpar reading experience. <br /><br /> I just read stuff without DRM now, so public domain stuff (fadedpage.com and gutenberg.org), webnovels (royalroad.com, ao3.org) and wikibooks. <i>MUCH</i> better experience. KOReader rocks. <br /> Anyways, I thought to try audiobooks since I don't always feel like reading with my eyes. By this time, I'd forgotten Libby existed, since I deleted the app a while ago, so I began <a href="https://librivox.org/the-adventures-of-sherlock-holmes-by-sir-arthur-conan-doyle-2/">Mark F. Smith's reading of <i>Sherlock Holmes</i></a> on LibriVox. I really enjoyed the first part, so I'll definitely be finishing it before using Libby again. <br /><br />
On another, also unrelated note, PressReader's nice. I've never really read the news before, mostly because news websites just have <i>so much</i> content added to them each day, how am I supposed to know what matters and what doesn't? The few good solutions I've found are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events">Wikipedia's Current Events</a>, <a href="https://newsasfacts.com">News as Facts</a> (which sources from the former) and <a href="https://www.newsminimalist.com">News Minimalist</a>. PressReader has The Economist, which has a weekly briefing instead of a daily one. Not yet sure which I'll pick, if any.</td>

<td>Oct 25</td>
<td>Also went good. Didn't have such good sleep last night so the practice exams I did after weren't too good. Did a good bit of writing in ghostwriter to organise my thoughts (link it here). Overall pretty chill day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oct 26</td>
<td>By far the best day yet. Went hiking with my family, also enjoyed that.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oct 27</td>
<td>Another success :D <br /> <br /> PressReader's app is actually <i>not</i> so good, so I've trashed that in favour of Reuter's daily podcast. I use Capy Reader for RSS feeds, and like its simplicity. Did my weekly review today, feeling good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Oct 28</td>
<td>Also good. My days feel quite boring and repeated, though. Practice exams, CS50, smaller admin tasks, read and walk about the house until bedtime. Can I do anything to spice things up?</td>
