<h1 id="closeted-exmuslim">closeted exmuslim</h1>
<p>The title may be slightly misleading; I am still, just barely, a
Muslim. I will, however, say that my experiences surrounding religion
the past 3-ish years match the label well, so we’ll be running with it
throughout the post. Also, I probably was Islamically considered an
apostate at some point, so I don’t think it’s any inaccurate either.
I’ll begin with my childhood, and then lead up to the present day. I’m
still very uncertain about many things (as is everyone), so don’t take
this as a shill post (or hate post) for the ideology.</p>
<p>My dad put me into a weekend madrassa when I was
about 5 or 6. It was there I learnt to read Arabic and the basics of
the faith. Indoctrination, at its simplest. I was told that was the way
things were and to just accept it. I lived in London, in an area where
the sunny side of the religion was the only side seen, so everything
seemed to align fine. I was a believer of truth, in a world where most
had gone astray. This is also where I met a close friend, we’ll call her
Bread.</p>
<p>Bread was my best friend in the 7 years I spent there, and made many
of my happiest moments possible. We’d go to eachother’s houses (and hide
in my dad’s car when we couldn’t), meet eachother for evening prayers,
play in the local park and spend time together at whatever opportunity
we could get. It was during this time that memorising the Quran started
to feel like a drag, and I’d begun trying to find ways to trick my
teachers into making me do less of it. I never thought of it as a
<em>bad</em> thing, though. Bread was at madrassa, and Bread was my best
friend! How could I possibly not like the place?</p>
<p>We had yearly ceremonies where the best students from each class got
a trophy for their efforts, and I was always one of the top 3. Quranic
and academic prowess were the only things my parents liked me for, why
would I dare to slack off on them? My teachers and classmates would
praise me, and I got to spend more time with Bread - yay!</p>
<p>Point is, Bread and the praises kept me hooked in.</p>
<p>Then came August 2021. I was 11 at the time when my mother gave me
the wonderful news of a family holiday. We’d go to Pakistan, and live in
a big house with three floors, and meet our cousins and it was going to
be the best time ever. The <em>best</em>. The following month was our
flight, and we stayed in my grandfather’s house for the initial part of our stay</p>
<p>October… November… December…</p>
<p>… Wait a minute.</p>
<p>I’d ask my parents when we’d go back, only to receive a cryptic,
vague mix of “We’ll see” or “InshaAllah”, and some other words strung
to them. This wasn’t an ordinary holiday. Another month passed and we
had our house. Another and I had begun school again. Another and my Dad
started pushing us to memorise Quran again.</p>
<p><em>Where’s Bread?</em></p>
<p>Everything had flipped upside down, the wrong way around. Everybody
spoke the funny samosa language, and I’m not the golden child anymore?
The food here’s spicy as hell, and there’s no Asda, Tesco’s or Lidl from
where we can buy <em>actually good</em> food.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No hate to South Asian cuisine. It’s fire (literally and
metaphorically), just not for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>School was also <em>very</em> different. I used to wear grey
trousers, a white collared shirt, navy blazer and tie. Here, I had to
wear these uncomfortable baggy trousers and a really long shirt with
slits? And a scarf to cover my chest? Eh? My brother could wear the
trousers and shirt fine, but if I asked to I was now suddenly denied?
The girls at school would refuse to talk to me, and let out snickers
even the language barrier couldn’t protect me from. They clearly didn’t
like me, but why? I still got straight A’s, I was still the same person.
Why was everything suddenly flipped? I couldn’t wear shirts and trousers
<em>at all</em> now. My mum would press me to wear shalwar kameez, and
cover my chest whenever we had guests (even family!) or went out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dupatta thing is honestly so fucking stupid. I used to spend so
much time just fixing it so my chest wouldn’t be obvious (fuck gravity
and the wind). It became so annoying that I just decided to wrap it
around my head and use a pin to keep it in place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then dropped out of school for a year and a half, mostly to cry in
my bedroom with the door shut. I’d beg my mother to sleep with me at
night like I was 3 again. I was irritated and began sobbing at basically
everything.</p>
<hr />
<p>I turned to social media and the internet to fill the hole left by so
much appearing to be lost. I had often played Minecraft with Bread for
the first 9 months of our “holiday”, so I learnt to host a game server
locally with the help of r/admincraft. That had made Reddit a rather
appealing option, so I signed up for an account. I also played Genshin
Impact, and wanted to join its subreddit, too. <br /> Reddit had a sub for
basically everything, so I thought I’d run a search for some
Islam-related ones. Maybe I could find advice on what to do about my
revulsion to memorising the Quran. Maybe that’s why I’m so sad. I’m not
reading Quran, so Mum and Dad don’t love me as much.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; “muslim” <br /> &gt;&gt; r/Muslim <br /> &gt;&gt; r/MuslimCorner <br /> &gt;&gt; r/MuslimLounge <br /> &gt;&gt;
r/exmuslim</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My eyes skimmed down the list until the last caught them. Peculiar
name, doesn’t seem like the rest. What’s it about? A quick scroll
through the top page and confusion flooded my brain.</p>
<p>... You can <em>leave</em>?</p>
<p><em>Really</em>? I can just leave and not have to deal with any of
this? Why wasn’t I told this before? Oh, my goodness, things were going
to be so easy now –</p>
<p>My parents. Fuck, they wouldn’t let me off at all. Regardless, I
joined the sub and kept looking through it a while. Reading through the
posts and comments made me feel heard, like all the thoughts I could
never express were finally being spoken. Anything new I came across became something I
agreed with. I felt understood after 2 years of being isolated and
pushed back. Everything made sense. The sudden gap between me and my
elder brother, the pushiness to memorise the Quran,
the headscarf, the “truth” all came to light.</p>
<hr />
<p>I kept my feelings and opinions to myself. Things could only go
downhill if I were to speak up about them. I was also still very
conflicted, and unsure as to whether I wasn’t just being lied to again.
I also kept r/islam in my sub list, and just observed the parallels for
another year. It was in this year, 2023, that I began to come to terms
with the current state of affairs. We weren’t going back, and that was
that. There was nothing I could do about it. I also became less
self-centered and started to see how the move affected the lives of my
siblings and parents.</p>
<p>I began to pick up Urdu pretty quick, and became closer to my parents
again. My grades wavered a bit, but returned to their original altitude
soon enough. Maybe things aren’t that bad after all.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1ff88im/is_drawing_anything_living_haram/</p>
<p><em>Fuck.</em> Are we really doing this again? No way my
<em>only</em> hobby, drawing, is haram.</p>
<p>https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39806</p>
<p>Of course it is, why am I not suprised? Cue another year of
doomscrolling r/exmuslim and crying. Anyways… 2024 comes around and I’m
really just tired of everything. I have my iGCSEs around the corner and
my parents have had it with my tantrums. I do some back and forths on
r/islam and r/exmuslim from time to time, but whatever. It’s all so
messed up and I couldn’t care less. I, unfortunately, pick up enough
Urdu to understand almost all daily conversation, so Dad takes that as
an oppurtunity to start shoving Islam down my throat again.</p>
<p>I ask my mum and one of my cousins a few questions about the
religion, got pretty stupid answers. The main takeaways from my cousin
were that I haven’t yet “embraced my femininity” and that “I’ll
understand when I’m older”. I look back at all the things that initially
bothered me about the religion with a straight face, and look through
the supposed explanations myself.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/on7aok/everything_wrong_with_islam_updatedincomplete/</p>
<p>I don’t know whether it’s the result of cognitive dissonance, but I
think that most of it isn’t as bad as it seems? I think there’s nuance
and context that can be provided to put the bigger picture together and
make it seem not-so-bad? I may also just be continuing to believe in the
faith to preserve my comfort and sanity. I do think the core message of
the faith, to abandon wordly pleasures in favour of being righteous
(see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nafs) is a good direction. I also
think the way the religion is practiced (or seems to be) nowadays is far
from what the ideology actually is, so I plan to give the Quran and
classical literature a good read and make my own assessment. Maybe I
remain Muslim, maybe I don’t. I’ll take this slow and enjoy the ride,
and hopefully not become one of the twisted “Muslims” I observe in my
day-to-day during the process.</p>
<p>That’s kind of it. I’m taking things a bit slower now and will
hopefully be able to think more clearly make make betterly-informed
decisions as a result. I think I’ll go through, in no particular order:
<br />
<br />
- Yaqeen Institute’s curriculum 
<br />
- LQToronto’s renowned Arabic course 
<br />
- The Quran and some tafsir 
<br />
- A bit of Sahih Bukhari and its commentary 
<br />
- Classical literature 
<br />
- Stuff from different perspectives: salaf,
progressive, western, exmuslim etc</p>
<p>Maybe this is excessive and a “having every bite even though the
apple is rotten” situation, but I’ll see how things go, I guess. It’s
only fair to give this religion a proper chance before moving on,
considering how majorly and variably contorted it’s become.</p>
