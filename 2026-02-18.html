Welcome to my incredibly boring website.
I hope it's not a wall of monospaced text at the time you're reading this, future me should have done something about that.

I am tech-savvy, but not in the programmer way. Only in the reddit-and-hacker-news-lurker kind of way. Just through poking around in settings and menus of every software I lay my cursor upon do I have a *bit* more tech-literacy than the average Joe. I can also do slightly (emphasis on that) cooler stuff like hosting a Minecraft server.

I can't touch type, nor do I know my way around an IDE, package manager or configuration stuff. So using a static site generator is currently off the table. I would have wiggled past that by reading through a lot of wiki, reddit and obscure forum pages, but school's gobbled up most of my time.

> An arguably better setup would be hosting/using/whatevering the Gemini protocol instead, but I don't know any established services that do that free of charge.

This is a public diary/journal/log where I post whatever I feel like posting. I'm currently:

- studying for IGCSEs
- learning Python
- trying to practise GTD
- experimenting with methods of organisation/PIM/note-taking

... and a few other things that aren't solid enough to be worth sharing.
